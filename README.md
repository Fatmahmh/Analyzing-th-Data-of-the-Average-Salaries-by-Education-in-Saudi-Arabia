## The used Python libraries :
NumPy 
Pandas 
Matplotlib
Seaborn

## The motivation for the project:
The goal of this project is to use the Average Salaries by Education in Saudi Arabia Data to answer the following questions:
Q1. Does higher education lead to higher Salaries (Does the employers pay more for those who have higher degrees and education)?

Q3. Who gets higher salaries in Saudi Arabia, Females or Males? is there any gender discrimination?
Q4. How does the COVID-19 pandemic Impact The salaries?


## The files :
Salary_by_Education.csv file, The used dataset.
Code.ipynb file, document for the entire CRISP_DM process for this project.

## Summary of the results of the analysis

The following points are answers for the posed questions in the beginning as a result of this project :
1.The salary has a strong relationship with the level of education and it gets higher with the higher degrees.
